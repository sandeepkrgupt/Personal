Well, you can even install CNG kit your petrol car if needed. Remember, 
the CNG cylinder has to be tested every three years and its done by certified shops/firms. 
Last year it cost me Rs. 1500/- in a small city (Tier-2 city). 
Cost could vary from city to city. CNG station guys would have a good idea where it is done in your city. 
CNG saves a lot on fuel costs but if your kit is not factory fitted, 
better to be a bit more elaborate and patient when getting the kit installed. 
I had a tough time on two cars where CNG was later on installed. But in case of factory fitted kits, Maruti is the best. 
Having used factory fitted CNG car for 70,000 kms. 
I can vouch for good performance and excellent efficiency. 
If driven judiciously, CNG can give ridiculously good efficiency figures.

For older engines, there are chances that you might end up losing a bit of engine
life and engine may need a bit more tuning than regular. Beware of the kit you are getting installed from outside. 
And also search a bit more, talk to a few CNG car owners before selecting a particular kit.
